# Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

Used ethernet port and random online available pcap/npcap files for this proj.<br>
Following things learnt:
- Configuring, layout, filtering syntax/parameters
- Capture interfaces / long term capture
- Extracting files from PCAPs / tcpstream
- Resolving MAC & TCP ports, ipv4 & v6 addresses (name resolution)
- Manually configuring host names
- Some protocol analysis using statistics feature
- Using dumpcap to capture traffic and writing it to files using ring buffers (cmd)
